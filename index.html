      <h1>STEP ONE:</h1>
      <h2>Drop out of life</h2>
      <p>Stress out all day about asking your manager about going home. Rehearse exactly what you’re going to say a thousand times in your head, and stutter when you finally ask and they know you’re lying.</p>
      <p>Try and sneak out without anyone seeing you, and everyone does, and you tell them you’re sick and you laugh but they know too. Drive home without the radio on.</p>
      <p>Crawl in to bed in all of your clothes. It should be around 1pm now. Don’t open the curtains, don’t open the windows, don’t open the door <sup>1</sup>.</p>
      <p>Every car that goes past is someone you know, and they’re coming to get you. You fall asleep or you don’t and you stare at the walls and live someone else’s life until you don’t and you’re awake again.</p>
      <p>The sun should have gone down now <sup>2</sup>. You start to feel safe now but you haven’t gotten out of bed and you won’t for a while.</p>
      <p>Everything is calm now. It should be just before midnight now. You try to remember something to tell the other you but you fall asleep and forget and wake up not knowing who you’ll be today.</p>
      <p>Clean your room. It’s 11am now. No one has talked to you this entire time. Your body starts spinning, you lie down. You might fall asleep, you probably won’t.</p>
      <p>You wake up and the sun is down again.</p>
      <div class="notes">
        <hr>
        <p>1. It should be too hot in your room, so hot that your head pounds. Don’t drink any water. Don’t take any nurofen.</p>
        <p>2. At this point, you can get a drink of water, smoke a cigarette, or look at your phone for an hour. It is very important that you do not talk to anyone.</p>
      </div>
    </section>
    <section class="section page">
      <h1>STEP TWO:</h1>
      <h2>Leave the house</h2>
      <p>You haven’t eaten in a few days. Put on some clothes from the basket and go outside. Get in your car, don’t put on any music because it will make you feel sick. Go in to the supermarket and buy a few different things to drink but no food.</p>
      <p>Drive home, but go past your house and go around the block a few times. Get lost in the neighbourhood you live in. Watch everyone watching you driving past. They all know.</p>
      <p>Go back to bed, but open the windows this time. You wake up and it’s dark again.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="section page">
      <h1>EXERCISE:</h1>
      <h2>What’s around you right now?</h2>
      <p>1. Don’t get out of bed. Take a look around the room. What is around you right now? Write it down.</p>
      <p>2. What have you forgotten about? When’s the last time you did some washing? How many dishes are on your floor right now? Is there something you were meant to do today? Write it down.</p>
      <p>3. Is that car driving past coming in your driveway? Was that knock on your neighbour’s door or yours? Does somebody know that you’re home? Are they here right now?</p>
    </section>
    <section class="section page">
      <h1>STEP THREE:</h1>
      <h2>Eat something</h2>
      <p>Go in to your kitchen. Open the cupboard. Stare at everything you’ve forgotten about. Don’t throw out the rotten bread on the bottom shelf. Take some nurofen.</p>
      <p>Eat something. You’ll immediately feel sick and it will come straight back out of you. Drink some water and gag as it goes down.</p>
      <p>Make yourself a cup of tea. Go outside for a cigarette1. Don’t look directly at the sun. Try to remember what day of the week it is. You’ll feel lightheaded and almost pass out from smoking. Throw the rest of the cigarette on the lawn.</p>
      <p>Go back to bed and wait for the feeling to pass. At this point you may throw up if you need to.</p>
      <p>The feeling that you’re having is the last few days sticking to your skin. Turn on the TV, but don’t concentrate on what’s playing. If anyone calls you, watch it ring until they hang up. Don’t call back.</p>
      <p>Lie in bed and feel guilty about not being at work. It may be the weekend now, or it may be the middle of the week. Don’t check the date. Let your phone die.</p>
      <p>Fall back asleep. While you’re dreaming, you may see yourself living other lives briefly. Try not to panic. If you wake up back in the same one you were living before, try and forget the things you’ve seen.</p>
      <p>Drink some water. Close the windows.</p>
      <div class="notes">
        <hr>
        <p>1. You’re going to be able to hear other people down your street going about their lives like nothing is happening. Your neighbour will be working on the section with something you can’t recognise the sound of. No one can see you if you sit out the back of your house. No one can see you if you let your phone die. Don’t listen to music - it will make you panic. When you look at your body, you won’t recognise it. You will feel 16 for the rest of your life, even now as you are an adult. Everyone knows the kind of person you are. That’s why no one has talked to you in three days. Don’t check the time. Don’t look at what day it is. You don’t know which you you are right now. Take a piece of paper and write down what you want the other you to know. You won’t recognise yourself when you look back on this, so it’s important to note down anything you want to pass on. Look at how overgrown the lawns are. Check the driveway through the fence to see if the car door that just slammed is someone coming to get you. Your vision will start to blur from standing up. The smell of the cigarette will start to make you feel sick. Sit down on the ground and put your head between your knees. Follow the cracks in the concrete with your eyes. Let minutes or hours pass. Where are you right now? how many years have you lived in this house? When’s the last time someone has talked to you? What day is it today? Does anyone know about what happened? What’s the worst thing that could happen right now, and how long do you have before it does? You’re going to be able to hear other people down your street going about their lives like nothing is happening. Nothing is happening. Nobody knows you’re here. You can still bury this and pretend nothing happened. No one will ask about it. No one will know where you’ve gone. No one will notice how long you went away for. Everybody knows everything. You will never get past this. Nobody knows.</p>

      <h2>Is this the house you’ve always lived in? </h2>
      <p>1. What is the worst thing that could happen right now?</p>
      <p>2. Where will you go when everything falls apart? How long do you think you have?</p>
      <p>3. If you could remember one thing to tell the other you, what would it be? What’s around you right now? How long have you been in bed for? What day is it today?</p>

    <section class="section page">
      <h1>STEP FOUR:</h1>
      <h2>Have a shower</h2>
      <p>Get some clothes off your floor. Find the ones with the least stains on them. The feeling will pass if you stand up for long enough.</p>
      <p>Turn the shower on. Stare at yourself in the mirror until it fogs up. Do you recognise yourself? Which you are you right now?</p>
      <p>Get under the water. Stare at your arms until you don’t recognise yourself. Stare at the walls. The feeling will pass if you stand up for long enough. Which you are you right now? Was that a car in your driveway? Is someone at your door right now?</p>
      <p>The water doesn’t make you feel clean. Brush your teeth until they bleed, spit the water down the drain, make a hole in the wall with your fist.</p>

      <p>Go home from work. Try not to overthink it. Try not to feel guilty. There’s nothing to be scared of. Just because other people can’t see it, doesn’t mean it isn’t there.</p>
      <p>Drive home without the radio on. Don’t look at your phone. Take a second to breathe. Get some water and some food. Take your pills if you haven’t already.</p>
      <p>Sit on your bed, Open the curtains, open the windows, open the door <sup>1</sup>.</p>
      <p>You’re safe here. You fall asleep or you don’t and you stare at the walls and live someone else’s life until yours comes back slow.</p>

        <p>1. You’re going to be able to hear other people down your street going about their lives like nothing is happening. Everything hurts for them too. If you spend enough time with anyone, you’ll see their scars. Everything doesn’t just stop when you do. Leave the house. Make the world a less shitty place. Tell someone you care about them. Eat some food that doesn’t make you feel sick. Drink some water. Everyone feels like you do. We won’t be around for long. Earth is 1,300,000 times smaller than the sun. AI will pass the Turing test by 2045. 90% of the coral reefs will die by 2050. Water will become scarce. Plastic takes 450 years to decompose. Over 2 billion tonnes of waste is produced every year. The global population will reach 9 billion by 2042. Sea levels are expected to rise up to 4 meters over the next 10,000 years. In six months, no one will remember what you did. The earth will fall in to the sun in 7 billion years. Humanity has a 70% chance of surviving the next 500 years. Earth will be uninhabitable in 500 million years. Write a song. Draw a picture.
